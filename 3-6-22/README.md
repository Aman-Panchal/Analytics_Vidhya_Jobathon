# Problem Statement
A D2C startup develops products using cutting edge technologies like Web 3.0. Over the past few months, the company has started multiple marketing campaigns offline and digital both. As a result, the users have started showing interest in the product on the website. These users with intent to buy product(s) are generally known as leads (Potential Customers).

Leads are captured in 2 ways - Directly and Indirectly.

Direct leads are captured via forms embedded in the website while indirect leads are captured based on certain activity of a user on the platform such as time spent on the website, number of user sessions, etc.

Now, the marketing & sales team wants to identify the leads who are more likely to buy the product so that the sales team can manage their bandwidth efficiently by targeting these potential leads and increase the sales in a shorter span of time.

• Objective: Now, as a data scientist, your task at hand is to predict the propensity to buy a product based on the user's past activities and user level information.

 ## Problems :  Heart Disease a rising killer 
 
-In India, about 45 million people suffer from coronary artery disease.

-Death rate due to cardiovascular  disease is rose by around  34% from  155.7 to 209.1 per 1lakh  from 1990 to 2016.

-India has  1 doctor in 1445 patient.

-According to NITI Aayog India has 6 lakh  shortfall of doctors.

-In rural 70 % people live and doctors are 1/4 of urban area.
     
         India will soon bear the largest burden of heart disease globally
